# RandomScape Plugin
Current work in progress features/issues:
- Refactor, I'm tired of ctrl+f'ing
- Magic spellbook disabling sprites and clicks
- Proper ground item implementation
- Grand Exchange testing and handling(currently testing on IM/UIM)
- Possible changes to unusual stores that may have different interfaces
