# RandomScape Plugin
Based off a fork of the plugin hub bronzeman mode and inspired by Gudi's gamble good playthrough

Current work in progress features/issues:

- Magic spellbook disabling sprites and clicks
- Proper ground item implementation (fix current issue with noted items)
- Proper overlay with multiple selections instead of one unlock
- Grand Exchange testing and handling (currently testing on IM/UIM)
- Possible changes to unusual stores that may have different interfaces
