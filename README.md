# RandomScape Plugin
Based off a fork of the plugin hub bronzeman mode and inspired by Gudi's gamble good playthrough

Current work in progress features/issues:
- Refactor, I'm tired of ctrl+f'ing
- Magic spellbook disabling sprites and clicks
- Proper ground item implementation
- Various sound effects to ensure a gambling addiction
- Proper lottery wheel overlay with multiple selections instead of one unlock
- Grand Exchange testing and handling(currently testing on IM/UIM)
- Possible changes to unusual stores that may have different interfaces
